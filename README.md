# MiscellaneousProblems
Real Time Scenarios that contains basic logic to derive optimized solution to a problem.

Problems can be decidable and Undecidable :
         Decidable are : 1) Tractable problems(Polynomial time)
                         2) Intractable problems(Exponential time)
                         
Algorithmic wise Analysis:
    Analyzing a problem based on 5 factors:
      1) Performance comparison
      2) Resource consumption
      3) Register optimization(System programming)
      4) Power(Goal)
      5) Bandwidth(Distributed)
   
Programing wise analsysis:
    1) Reusability
    2) Recursive/Iterative
    3) Usage of local variables
    4) Usage of standard algorithmic methods/algorithms to feasible and optimized solution.
    5) Usage of sorting and searching methods based on applicable factors*
